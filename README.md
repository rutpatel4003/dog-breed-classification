# dog-breed-classification

The project was performed again with PyTorch instead of Tensorflow, and without hyper parameter tuning.
The result improved from 72% Train Accuracy and 75% Test Accuracy in Tensorflow to 79% Train Accuracy and 86% Test Accuracy in PyTorch, which is a substantial increase at a much faster training time (possibly due to usage of MobileNet instead of ResNet). 

For a 120 Class Dog Breed Classification, the F1-Score seemed pretty descent, at 0.85 or 85%.
